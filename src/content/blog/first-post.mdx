import ContactButton from "../../components/ContactButton.astro";

Hello! Glad to have you here. Welcome to my brand new personal portfolio. Who am I? I'm Jeff, a product-focused full-stack developer of web and mobile apps. Software development can be quite the journey so I'm hoping to offer a little bit of the insight that I've learned over the 10+ years that I've been at this game.

It's been quite a while since I've built a personal site for myself so over the first series of posts I'm going to outline my process and outline some of the highs and lows along the way.

For those that are curious, here's the current stack:

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
- [Typeform](https://typeform.com)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

This is the first time I've built anything using [Astro](https://astro.build) and am really enjoying the experience so far. This site is of course fully open source so feel free to view, fork, and criticize the code [over here](https://github.com/gotenoctober/gotenoctober.github.io). Thank you to Manuel Ernesto for providing an excellent starting point via the [Astrofy template](https://astro-modern-personal-website.netlify.app), which I've highly modified into what you see now.

Finally, if you're looking for with a development project...

...and let's see if we're a good fit to work together.
