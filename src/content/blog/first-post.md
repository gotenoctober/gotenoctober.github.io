Hello! Glad to have you here. Welcome to my brand new personal portfolio. Who am I? I'm Jeff, a product-focused full-stack developer of web and mobile apps. Software development can be quite the journey so I'm hoping to offer a little bit of the insight that I've learned over the 10+ years that I've been at this game.

It's been quite a while since I've built a personal site for myself. After a bit of experimenting this is the stack I landed on:

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
- [Typeform](https://typeform.com)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

This is the first time I've built anything using [Astro](https://astro.build) and am really enjoying the experience so far. This site is of course fully open source so feel free to view, fork, and criticize the code [over here](https://github.com/gotenoctober/gotenoctober.github.io). Thank you to Manuel Ernesto for providing an excellent starting point via the [Astrofy template](https://astro-modern-personal-website.netlify.app), which I've highly modified into what you see now.

Finally, if you're looking for help with a development project, [get in touch here](https://bit.ly/contact-jeff) and let's see if we're a good fit to work together.
