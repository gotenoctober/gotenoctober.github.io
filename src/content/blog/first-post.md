Hello! Glad to have you here. Welcome to my brand new personal portfolio. Who am I? I'm Jeff, a product-focused full-stack developer of web and mobile apps. Looking for help with your next product? Tap the handy button below to tell me more about you and your project.

It's been quite a while since I've built a personal site for myself so over the first series of posts I'm going to outline my process and outline some of the highs and lows along the way.

For those that are curious, here's the current stack:

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
- [Typeform](https://typeform.com)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

This is the first time I've built a site using [Astro](https://astro.build) and am really enjoying the experience so far. This site is of course fully open source so feel free to view, fork, and criticize the code [over here](https://github.com/gotenoctober/gotenoctober.github.io). Thank you to Manuel Ernesto for providing an excellent starting point via the [Astrofy template](https://astro-modern-personal-website.netlify.app).
